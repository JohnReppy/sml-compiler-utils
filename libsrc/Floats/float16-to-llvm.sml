(* float16-to-llvm-fn.sml
 *
 * This module supports converting 16-bit float literals to 8-byte bit
 * strings suitable for emitting into an LLVM assembler file.
 *
 * The LLVM assembler expects floating-point literals to be either decimal
 * literals that are exactly representable in floating-point, or hexidecimal
 * bit strings.  For 16, 32, and 64-bit floats, the bit strings must be
 * written as 16-digit hexidecimal numbers.  This requirement means that
 * the bit representation of the exponent and mantissa must be converted
 * to double-precision format.
 *
 * This code is based on code contributed by Kavon Farvardin.
